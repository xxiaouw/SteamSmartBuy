## ðŸ—‚ How They Work Together

1. **`data_collection.ipynb`** gathers raw data  
2. â†’ **`table_generation.ipynb`** cleans & organizes it  
3. â†’ **`score_calculation.ipynb`** computes deal index  
4. â†’ **`SQL_connection.ipynb`** pushes results to the database  

These notebooks together power the backend pipeline that supports the Power BI dashboard and ongoing deal analysis.
